# Client (React + Vite)

Install and run:

```powershell
cd client
npm install
npm run user (user dashboard)
npm run admin (admin dashboard)
npm run dev (for development)
```

Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173 and http://localhost:5174 if you running user and admin concurrently) or simply typing h + o on terminal.

Ensure the server is running at `http://localhost:4000`.
